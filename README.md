# OnlineShoppingPortal_MVC
Online shopping portal developed in MVC model

The main goal  is to provide an online web application for shoe
store, where user can search anything regarding shoes. The search can be performed in
two ways, such as basic and advanced search. In the first iteration, we have implemented
only the basic search functionality and navigation bar. In basic search, user can type
anything in the textbox and relevant results will be displayed with the most matching
result on the top of the page. In navigation bar, lists of categories are present with their
sub categories in order to ease the searching method for user.
